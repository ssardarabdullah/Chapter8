Question 9___________
Start with a copy of your program 
from Exercise 8-9. 
Write a function called 
send_messages() that prints each
text message and 
moves each message to a new list
    called sent_messages as itâ€™s 
    printed. After 
calling the function, print both 
of your lists to make sure the 
messages were 
moved correctly.


solution _____________
def show_messages(messages):
    for message in messages:
        print(message)
def send_messages(messages, sent_messages):
    while messages:
        current_message = messages.pop(0)
        print(f"Sending message:
        {current_message}") 
        sent_messages.append(current_message)
messages = ["Hello!", "How are you?",
            "See you soon.", "Have a great day!"]
sent_messages = []
send_messages(messages, sent_messages)
print("\nOriginal messages list:", messages)
print("Sent messages list:", sent_messages)
